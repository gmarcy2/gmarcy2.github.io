<p>The entire landscape of college athletics has been flipped on its head in recent years. If you look back at the beloved treasure of college sports from just a decade ago you wouldn’t recognize a lot. For the longest time conferences were generally orchestrated geographically. The SEC would be teams from the south, the Big Ten teams from the Midwest, the ACC the schools along the coast and the PAC 12 would be teams out west. But those days are no more. USC and UCLA in the Big Ten, Texas and Oklahoma in the SEC, it’s all craziness. Former staples of their conferences just got up and left the table, leaving decades of history behind. </p>

<p>Not only have athletes continued to get better to make a better product over time due to better knowledge, training, technology, and new ideas but the national attention is different. Media has continued to evolve and grow but it has begun to impact college athletics through social media, highlight clips spreading and most importantly television deals. The new television deals signed by the Big Ten and SEC conferences have dramatically changed the lives of student athletes across the country. The Big Ten signed a new deal with FOX, CBS and NBC for over 7 billion dollars. Yea you read that right. With this deal the conference is projected to distribute between 80 -100 million dollars per year to each of its members. They weren’t the only ones making big moves though. The SEC reached an agreement with ESPN that brings each member of the conference roughly $120 million per year. </p>

<p>With details of these deals emerging, other schools around the country with larger fan bases and bigger markets began to take notice. Bigger schools in the Big 12 and PAC 12 began to become interested in switching conferences to take advantage of these deals. The first dominoes to fall were Oklahoma and Texas leaving the Big 12 to join the SEC. Next, it was USC and UCLA to the Big Ten. </p>

<p>The growing belief was that if you did not jump on the wagon of joining the SEC or Big Ten then your university would be in trouble.</p> 

<p>“It became obvious that standing pat would mean falling behind,” said Joe Castiglione, Oklahoma’s athletic director. “It would mean putting our program in a precarious position, both competitively and financially. It would leave us to play catch-up with our competition.” </p>

<p class="caption"><em>The new look SEC</em></p>

<p>NCAA athletic programs aren’t cheap. Schools across the country spend millions and millions of dollars on all sports on campus. This spending includes facilities and equipment, medical expenses, recruiting spending, travel and game expenses, coaches’ salaries, corporate sponsorship, advertising, licensing and so much more.</p> 

<p>With Texas and Oklahoma venturing into the SEC, I wanted to compare the total athletic spending of the two schools with the rest of their new conference opponents.</p>

      <!-- EXAMPLE OF A DATAWRAPPER EMBED --> 
<iframe title="2022 SEC Total Athletic Expenses" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-037I3" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/037I3/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

<p>The graph shows that if Texas was in the SEC in 2022, it would be the biggest spenders. The Longhorns spent almost 30 million dollars more than the next closest school (LSU) and doubled the total athletic spending of last place Mississippi State. Oklahoma is no slacker as well; the Sooners spent the fourth most in 2022.</p>

<p>One potential reason for the former big twelve teams being on top is they have more school sponsored sports. 
“The Big 12 tends to have more sports than the SEC so one of the many reasons why Oklahoma and Texas would be on the higher end is because they have more sports they have to cover and support,” said Rick Thorpe, deputy athletics director of external engagement at Arkansas.</p>

<p>The SEC is a conference known for their dominance in college football. The league leads all conferences with 30 national championships and the most first round picks since 2000 (209). You don’t achieve all this success in football overnight. It’s a long process to create a steady foundation of success but most importantly it really takes a large amount of money. 
Texas and Oklahoma are two programs that enter the conference with rich football history. Oklahoma has seven national championships; seven Heisman Trophy winners and the Sooners lead all FBS programs with four different 100-win coaches in school history. While Texas has the second most bowl game appearances with 55, fourth in bowl game victories with 29 and is one of the biggest brands in college athletics.</p>

<p>The Longhorns and Sooners would fall in the middle of the pack in terms of 2022 football spending in the SEC. For two historic football programs being average is not something they are accustomed to. So, looking ahead to life in the SEC, Texas and Oklahoma may have to open the checkbooks to compete on the gridiron.</p>

<p>According to Thorpe, the conference has partially been so successful in football because since they have less school sponsored teams, they can spend more on football than other conferences who have more sports to fund. </p>

<p>To no surprise the schools that spend the most money on football have the most success on Saturdays. Alabama and Georgia have spent the most money and those schools have dominated the conference. One of the two schools have been in the conference championship for each of the past ten title games and won 9/10. The two schools have faced each other in the conference championship twice in the past three seasons. The Bulldogs and the Crimson Tide led the conference in spending in 2022 and both finished in the nation’s top five. </p>
